<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m a Software Developer with a passion to learn something new every day. I&rsquo;m currently a C#/.NET student at Grand Circus Bootcamp in Detroit, MI. I started to be interested in programming as a teenager with my dad showing me online code tutorials. I&rsquo;m passionate about programming because I love solving logical puzzles, as well as creating things and watching them come to life. My plans are to become a full-time developer, and to work on apps and games with my friends just for fun.</span></p>
